Cemaritan makes coordinated entry easy. With Cemaritan, your Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) syncs conveniently with the HMIS of other service providers in your Continuum of Care (CoC) and outside your CoC, allowing for better intakes, easier referrals, and better connections between service providers. Cemaritan and its underlying software are all open-source technology.

This repository is the implementation powering app.cemaritan.com
